# Cyber Kill Chain Stages

1. **Reconnaissance**  
   During this stage, the attacker gathers information about the target. This can be achieved through probing digital servers, speaking with people close to the target, or just reading the news!

2. **Weaponization**  
   Once a specific vulnerability has been identified, a piece of malware is designed to exploit it. This process can range from downloading a sample of a database, purchasing a tool from a third party, or developing something custom.

3. **Delivery**  
   The chosen malware must be sent to the target in some manner. Despite progress over the years, the most common method is still via email. Other methods can include website downloads and infected or modified USB devices.

4. **Exploitation**  
   Once malware is given to the target, it activates and performs a series of instructed steps. How this occurs is highly variable and depends on many details about the programs and operating system in use. This process is known as "exploiting a vulnerability," and the software used to do it is known as exploit code or an exploit.

5. **Installation**  
   The malware attempts to get some element of persistence within the target system. This can be achieved through the creation of backdoors, which can include creating new accounts, installing remote access programs, or introducing new vulnerabilities into the system. These factors mean that if the original vulnerability is patched, it is too late for the defender as the attackerâ€™s access remains.

6. **Command and Control (C2)**  
   A method for the attacker to communicate with the compromised systems must be established. This enables instructions and upgrades to be sent to the target and for data to be sent back to the attacker. This can be done using websites, direct connections, and even Twitter.

7. **Actions on Objectives**  
   Once all the previous steps have been completed, the attacker is free to complete the original intent. This could range from stealing data, modifying data, or destroying key system elements.
