# SECURITY CONTROLS

Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They include a wide range of tools that protect assets before, during, and after an event.

Security controls can be organized into three types:
- **TECHNICAL**: Include the many technologies used to protect assets. This includes encryption, authentication systems, and others.
- **OPERATIONAL**: Relate to maintaining the day-to-day security environment. Generally, people perform these controls like awareness training and incident response.
- **MANAGERIAL**: Are centered around how the other two reduce risk.  
  - Examples of management controls:
    - Policies
    - Standards
    - Procedures
