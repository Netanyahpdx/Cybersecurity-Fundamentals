# DATA IN MOTION

</div>

<div align="center">

Data in motion refers to data actively being transmitted from one location to another, such as over a network, between devices, or within system components.

</div>

## Examples:
- Emails being sent over the internet.
- Streaming video or audio, like Netflix or Spotify.
- File transfers over FTP or cloud storage services.
- Data sent between your web browser and a website (e.g., HTTP requests).
- Sensor data sent from IoT devices to a server.

## Security Considerations:
Since data in motion traverses networks (often public or insecure), it is vulnerable to interception or tampering. To protect it:
- **Encryption:** Use protocols like TLS (Transport Layer Security) or IPSec.
- **Authentication:** Verify the sender and receiver using certificates or tokens.
- **Secure Channels:** Implement VPNs for private communications.
