# DATA AT REST

</div>

<div align="center">

Data at rest refers to data that is stored on a device or storage medium and is not actively being transmitted or processed. This includes data stored on hard drives, SSDs, USB drives, cloud storage, or backup tapes.

</div>

## Examples:
- Databases stored on a server.
- Files saved on a local hard drive or SSD.
- Backups stored on external storage devices or cloud storage.
- Archived emails stored on a mail server.
- Application data stored on mobile devices or desktops.

## Security Considerations:
Since data at rest is stationary, it is vulnerable to breaches through physical or logical access. To protect it:
- **Encryption:** Use full-disk encryption (e.g., BitLocker or LUKS) or file-level encryption.
- **Access Controls:** Restrict access to authorized users using permissions or role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Physical Security:** Ensure secure storage of devices and backups to prevent theft or tampering.
