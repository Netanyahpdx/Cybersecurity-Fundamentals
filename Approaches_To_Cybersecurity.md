## APPROACHES TO CYBERSECURITY
IN CYBERSECURITY, DIFFERENT APPROACHES ARE USED TO MANAGE AND MITIGATE RISKS, ENSURING THAT AN ORGANIZATION'S SYSTEMS, DATA, AND NETWORKS REMAIN PROTECTED.

### 1. COMPLIANCE BASED APPROACH: 
ENSURES THAT AN ORGANIZATION MEETS REGULATORY AND LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CYBERSECURITY, SUCH AS DATA PROTECTION LAWS AND INDUSTRY SPECIFIC STANDARDS. 
- **KEY FEATURES:**
  - Follows established frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS.
  - Often focuses on documenting policies and procedures to demonstrate compliance.
  - Provides a structured, audit-ready way of managing cybersecurity practices.
- **ADVANTAGES:**
  - Ensures legal and regulatory compliance.
  - Reduces legal and financial risks due to non-compliance.
- **DISADVANTAGES:**
  - Can be overly rigid, focusing more on meeting standards than on actual risk management.
  - May lead to a "checklist mentality" where compliance is achieved without fully addressing cybersecurity risks.

### 2. AD HOC APPROACH:
CYBERSECURITY MEASURES ARE IMPLEMENTED AS NEEDED, OFTEN WITHOUT A FORMAL OR CONSISTENT FRAMEWORK.
- **KEY FEATURES:**
  - Reactive, not proactive, with security measures deployed when a threat or issue arises.
  - Often lacks clear policies, procedures, or guidelines for cybersecurity.
  - The focus is on addressing immediate threats, rather than long-term risk management.
- **ADVANTAGES:**
  - Flexible and able to respond quickly to emerging threats.
  - May be appropriate for small organizations or startups with limited resources.
- **DISADVANTAGES:**
  - Highly unstructured and inconsistent.
  - Risks of missed vulnerabilities, gaps in security, and a lack of coordination.
  - Not scalable or sustainable as the organization grows.

### 3. RISK BASED APPROACH:
IDENTIFIES AND PRIORITIZE RISKS BASED ON THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT AND LIKELIHOOD, THEN IMPLEMENTS CONTROLS TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS. 
- **KEY FEATURES:**
  - Involves continuous risk assessments to understand the organizationâ€™s threat landscape.
  - Focus on resource allocation to mitigate the highest-priority risks first.
  - A proactive, data-driven approach that helps balance security with business objectives.
- **ADVANTAGES:**
  - Focused on high-impact risks and threats.
  - Allows for more efficient use of resources by addressing the most critical vulnerabilities first.
  - Provides a tailored security posture based on the unique risk profile of the organization.
- **DISADVANTAGES:**
  - Requires regular risk assessments and updates.
  - Can be resource-intensive, especially in large organizations or those with complex environments.

### SUMMARY COMPARISON:

| APPROACH             | FOCUS                           | ADVANTAGES                             | DISADVANTAGES                       |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Compliance-Based** | Meeting regulatory requirements | Ensures legal compliance, audit-ready  | Can be rigid, "checklist mentality" |
| **Ad Hoc**           | Reactive, as-needed measures    | Flexible, quick response to threats    | Inconsistent, unstructured          |
| **Risk-Based**       | Managing risks based on impact  | Tailored, efficient, data-driven       | Requires continuous assessment      |

Each approach has its strengths and is suitable for different organizational needs. 
Sometimes, a **hybrid** of these approaches is used, which includes blending these to meet the organization's needs.
