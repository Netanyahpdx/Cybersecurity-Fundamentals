# Cybersecurity-Fundamentals
Hey there!
I'm super new to this whole cybersecurity world, and if you're new too, you might find this profile relatable. 
If not, well... I might not be the most exciting read yet! ðŸ˜„
I've been diving into tons of courses to learn the basics, with hopes of eventually landing a job in cybersecurity. 
Since I've been taking a lot of notes along the way, I thought it would be a good idea to share them here. 
Iâ€™m hoping to connect with other beginnersâ€”maybe we can help each other out along the way!
If you're here, I hope you find something useful. I'd love to connect with fellow learners, so feel free to reach out!
