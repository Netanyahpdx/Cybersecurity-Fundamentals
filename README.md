# Cybersecurity-Fundamentals
Hey! I am super new to all of this. Hopefully you are too, or you are going to find my profile incredibly boring.
I have been taking tons of courses to learn the basics and hopefully, eventually, find a job. Since I have been 
taking tons of notes, I figured it would be a good idea to share them here in hopes that I can connect with 
some other beginners and maybe we can help eachother out? Hopefully yall find your way here. I'd love to 
connect with other people! <3 N
