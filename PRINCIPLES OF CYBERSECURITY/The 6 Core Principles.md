    <h1> THE 6 CORE PRINCIPLES OF CYBERSECURITY </h1>
    <br><br>
    <h2> 1. CONFIDENTIALITY: </h2>
    <h3> Confidentiality ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive data, keeping it secure from unauthorized viewers. </h3>
    <i> Ex: Encryption methods protect sensitive emails so that only the intended recipient can open and understand them. </i>
    <br><br>
    <h2> 2. AUTHENTICITY: </h2>
    <h3> Authenticity confirms that users or systems are who they claim to be. This principle ensures that only legitimate users can access protected resources. </h3>
    <i> EX: If someone logs into a system, the system verifies their identity through their username, password, or multi-factor authentication.  </i>
    <br><br>
    <h2> 3. NON-REPUDIATION: </h2>
    <h3> Non-repudiation guarantees that the sender of a message cannot deny sending it. This principle is vital for accountability. </h3>
    <i> Ex: When sending an email with a digital signature, the sender cannot later claim they didn't send it. The signature serves as proof that the message came from them. </i>
     <br><br>
    <h2> 4. INTEGRITY: </h2>
    <h3> Integrity ensures that the information remains accurate and unmodified during its lifecycle. </h3>
    <i> Ex: When you download a file from the internet, integrity ensures the file hasnâ€™t been tampered with during transfer. Using tools like hash functions to verify that the file you receive is identical to the original. </i>
    <br><br>
    <h2> 5. ACCESS CONTROL: </h2>
    <h3> Access control defines who can access certain data and what they can do with it. </h3>
    <i> Ex: In a company, an employee may have access to financial data but not to HR records. The system sets up permissions to restrict or grant access based on user roles, ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible to those who need it. </i>
    <br><br>
    <h2> 6. AVAILABILITY: </h2>
    <h3> Availability ensures that information and resources are accessible to authorized users whenever needed. </h3>
    <i> Ex: Cloud services maintain availability by using backup servers and redundancy to ensure the system stays up and running, even in the event of a technical failure. </i>
