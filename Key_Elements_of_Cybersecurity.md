    <h2> 1. APPLICATION SECURITY: </h2>
    <p> 
      Focuses on protecting software applications during development to prevent cyberattacks. It aims to secure websites and online applications from vulnerabilities in their source code. A major focus of application security today is on cloud-based services. 
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2> 2. INFORMATION SECURITY: </h2>
    <p> 
      Information security is a key aspect of cybersecurity focused on protecting data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. It safeguards company data, code, and information collected from clients and users. The core principles of information security are Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, collectively known as the CIA Triad.

      <h2> 4. DISASTER RECOVERY PLANNING (BUSINESS CONTINUITY): </h2>
      <p> 
        These focus on focus on ensuring that essential business functions can continue or quickly resume after a disaster. DRP identifies critical applications and outlines recovery strategies, while BCP prepares organizations for potential cyber threats by assessing risks and determining how to maintain operations during disruptions.
