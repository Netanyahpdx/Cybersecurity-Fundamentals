## DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DATA IN MOTION & DATA IN REST

| **Aspect**        | **Data in Motion**                                  | **Data at Rest**                                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **State**         | Actively moving/transmitting.                      | Stationary and stored.                          |
| **Risk Exposure** | More vulnerable to interception (e.g., MITM attacks).| Vulnerable to breaches via physical or logical access. |
| **Protection**    | Encryption during transmission (e.g., HTTPS, VPN). | Encryption of stored data (e.g., disk encryption). |
| **Examples**      | Emails, video streams, data backups being transferred. | Stored databases, cloud files, offline backups.  |
