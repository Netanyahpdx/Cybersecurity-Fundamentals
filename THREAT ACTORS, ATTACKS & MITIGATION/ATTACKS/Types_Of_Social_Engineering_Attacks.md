##SOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTACKS
A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. These attacks rely on convincing people to trust the attacker and make mistakes. They may pretend to know someoneone trustworthy or create a situation where the victim feels pressured to act without thinking.
*Some of these may overlap*

### PHISHING:
The most common type of social engineering attack. 
Scammers use any form of communication (usually emails) to “fish” for information. These messages look identical to ones from trusted sources like organizations and people you know.
GOALS OF A PHISHING SCAM:
- Get you to click a link
- Get you to download an attachment. Scammers will disguise malware and viruses as attachments, so when you download it, your device becomes infected.
- Get you to enter your credentials on a website. Anything you enter goes straight to them. This can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, account takeovers, corporate espionage, and more. 
SPECIFIC EXAMPLE: In 2022, a sophisticated phishing attack aimed at stealing Office 365 credentials, where attackers impersonated the US Department of Labor (DoL). This scam exemplifies the increasing sophistication and convincing nature of modern phishing attempts.

### SPAM / MASS PHISHING:
Aa\ny unsolicited and often irrelevant or inappropriate messages sent over the internet, typically to a large number of users, primarily for advertising, phishing, spreading malware, or other similar purposes. 
Spam email content usually promotes a product or service and provides contact details for recipients to place an order.
TYPES OF SPAM:
- EMAIL SPAM: Most widely recognized for of spam. It involved unsolicitated messages sent to tons of people They range from annoying advertisements, to malicious, containing malware or phishing schemes. 
- INSTANT MESSAGING SPAM: Same thing as email spam, but via instant messaging platforms. Also known as SpIM Spam over Instant Messaging. They can be promotions, ads, or links to malicious sites.
- SOCIAL MEDIA SPAM: Fake accounts, unsolicited direct messages, or spammy post comments on platforms like FB, X, and Instagram
- SEARCH ENGINE SPAM: Spammers manipulate search engines to display particular content, usually promotional or deceptive, using techniques like keyword stuffing, cloaking, or doorway pages. 
- BLOG COMMENT SPAM: Spammers flood blogs with irrelevant or promotional comments to generate backlinks or lure unsuspecting users to malicious sites. The comments are usually irrelevant and unrelated to the post itself. 
- SMS (TXT MESSAGING) SPAM: Like email spam but via text messaging. It often promotes dubious products, fake contests, or phishing attempts. 
- CALL SPAM / ROBOCALLS: Unsolicited pre-recorded calls that advertise a product, make false claims about winning a prize or the lottey, or trying to scam the recipient.
- TRACKBACK / PINGBACK SPAM: Spammers use trackbacks and pingacks in blogging platforms to notify when one blog links to another. They abuse this feature to generate links to their sites. 
- IMAGE SPAM: In order to bypass text spam filters, spammers embed text into images. They are usually ads or malicious links.

### SOCIAL MEDIA PHISHING:
Social media phishing involves attackers using platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, or Twitter to target users and steal sensitive information, such as login credentials, personal data, or even financial details. This form of phishing exploits the casual and interactive nature of social networks.
STEPS:
1. FAKE PROFILES: Attackers create fake profiles impersonating friends, colleagues, influencers, or brands.
2. MALICIOUS LINKS OR REQUESTS: They send direct messages, post comments, or share links, leading victims to fake login pages or malicious websites.
3. GAINING TRUST: Some attackers engage in conversations or interactions to build trust before making their move.
4. CREDENTIAL THEFT OR MALWARE:  Victims unknowingly provide credentials or download malicious files.

---

### SPEAR PHISHING:
A more targeted version of phishing.
Spear phishing targets specific individuals or firms. They customize the message based on information about the target which makes it more convinving. 
REAL WORLD EXAMPLE: As world leaders deliberated on the best response to the escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, Microsoft issued a warning in February 2022 about a new spear phishing campaign by a Russian hacking group targeting Ukrainian public sector entities and NGOs.The group, known as Gamaredon and tracked by Microsoft as ACTINIUM, had reportedly targeted “organizations critical to emergency response and ensuring the security of Ukrainian territory” since 2021.

### WHALING:
A highly targeted phishing attack aimed at executives or high-ranking individuals within an organization, such as CEOs, CFOs, or board members. The term "whaling" reflects the size and importance of the target—like going after a "big fish." These attacks often leverage detailed research about the victim to create convincing messages.
STEPS:
1. RESEARCH: Attackers gather personal and professional details about the target from public sources (e.g., LinkedIn, social media, company websites).
2. IMPERSONATION: The attacker sends a tailored email or message, often appearing to come from a trusted colleague, partner, or official organization.
3. PAYLOAD: The message may request sensitive information, direct the victim to a malicious link, or ask for a fraudulent wire transfer.
4. OUTCOME: The attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive data, financial assets, or company systems.

### SMISHING / SMS PHISHING:
Smishing is a cyber-attack that targets individuals through SMS (Short Message Service) or text messages. The term is a combination of “SMS” and “phishing.”
In a smishing attack, cybercriminals send deceptive text messages often appearing to be from a trusted source, in order to lure victims into sharing personal or financial information, click on malicious links, or download harmful software or applications. 
they use social engineering tactics to create a sense of urgency, curiosity, or fear to manipulate the recipient into taking an undesired action.
STEPS: 
1. CRAFTING THE MESSAGE: The attackers create a deceptive text message that invokes a specific emotion or reaction, such as urgency, fear, or curiosity. This message typically includes a call to action, like clicking a link or calling a number. 
2. MESSAGE DELIVERY: Using SMS gateways, spoofing tools, or infected devices, the attacker sends out the smishing message to their selected targets. 
3. INTERACTION: The victim is then prompted to take action by clicking a link, replying with personal information, or calling a phone number.
4. DATA COLLECTION OR MALWARE DEPLOYMENT: 
5. USE OF STOLEN INFORMATIONIf the victim falls for it, the information can then be used to steal someone's identity, make unauthorized transactions, sell the data on the black market, or further targetted attacks.
6. EVASION: Attackers will change tactics, use different phone numbers, and mask their identity and location.

### ANGLER PHISHING:
Involves attackers using fake social media profiles or impersonating customer service accounts to trick users into revealing personal information or credentials. This type of phishing thrives on the rapid, casual nature of social media interactions.
STEPS:
1. A victim posts on social media, tagging a company (e.g., to report a problem).
2. An attacker responds, posing as customer support, and asks the victim to share personal information or click on a malicious link.
3. The victim, thinking the account is legitimate, provides sensitive data or downloads malware.

---

### QUID PRO QUO PHISHING:
Involves attackers offering a service, benefit, or prize in exchange for sensitive information. The term "quid pro quo" means "something for something."
STEPS:
1. The attacker contacts the victim, claiming to be from a legitimate organization (e.g., IT support).
2. They offer a reward (e.g., a gift card, software fix, or tech upgrade) in exchange for the victim's credentials, system access, or other information.
3. The victim, enticed by the offer, complies, and the attacker gains what they’re after.

---

### MOBILE PAYMENT APP PHISHING:
Mobile payment app phishing targets users of apps like Venmo, PayPal, or Cash App, aiming to steal login credentials, financial details, or funds.
STEPS:
1. The victim receives an email, text, or notification claiming there’s a problem with their mobile payment account.
2. A link directs them to a fake website or app resembling the legitimate platform.
3. The victim enters their credentials, which are stolen by the attacker.

---

### VISHING:
Vishers use fraudulent phone numbers, voice-altering software, text messages, and social engineering to trick users into divulging sensitive information. Vishing generally uses voice to trick users.

---

### CEO (EXECUTIVE FRAUD):
Attackers spoof the CEO or another high level executive. The goal is to convince the employee to send the attacker money or confidential information like intellectual property or credentials. 

---

### USB BAITING:
Involves exploiting human curiosity and trust to gain unauthorized access to a victim's device, often leading to the installation of malware. Here's how it works and why it qualifies as a social engineering attack:
STEPS:
1. THE LURE: The attacker leaves the USB drive in a location where people are likely to find it, and they label it with something intriguing to make the victim want to explore the contents.
2. CURIOSITY OR GREED: The victim, curious about what is on the USB drive or tempted by the label, decides to plug it into their computer or device.
3. MALWARE INSTALLATION: Once the USB drive is plugged into the victim's computer, it can automatically install malware, ransomware, or viruses, or it could be used to collect sensitive data from the computer (like login credentials, personal files, or network information).
4. EXPLOITATION: The malware may allow the attacker to take control of the victim's device, steal data, or compromise an organization's network if the victim has access to a company system.

---

### PRETEXTING:
Another form of social engineering involving creating a fabricated scenario to steal information. The attacker pretends to need the information to confirm the victim’s identity or to help with a supposed emergency.
STEPS:
1. RESEARCH AND INFORMATION GATHERING: The initial phase where the bad actor does extensive research about the target. 
2. SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT: Next, they develop a plausible scenario tailored to their target. 
3. BUILDING TRUST AND ESTABLISHING AUTHORITY: Once the target is contacted (by phone, email, or in person), the attacker uses psychological tactics to build rapport and establish authority within their assumed role. 
4. EXECUTION OF REQUEST: Now that they've established trust, the attacker makes direct requests for sensitive data, access permission, PINs, financial records, or they convince the victim to perform actions beneficial for further compromising security measures. 
5. DATA COLLECTION AND EXIT STRATEGY: Once the attacker has the information, they collect and secure it for their intended use. The exit strategy is executed with precision so that they can't be traced.
REAL LIFE EXAMPLE: Hewlett-Packard pretexting scandal (2006): HP hired investigators to impersonate the company’s own board members and journalists to obtain their phone records through pretexting techniques. This scandal highlighted the legal and ethical implications of pretexting, resulting in changes to U.S. laws regarding the use of such social engineering tactics to obtain personal records.

### DEEPFAKES:
manipulated videos or audio that use artificial intelligence (AI) to create realistic impersonations of people. These can be used to deceive victims into believing something that isn't true.
HOW THEY RELATE TO SOCIAL ENGINEERING:
Deepfakes can be used to impersonate a trusted person (like a CEO or government official), leading to fraud or scams. For example, an attacker might use a deepfake of a company executive to instruct an employee to transfer funds or share sensitive data.

---

### URL PHISHING / DOMAIN SPOOFING / WEBSITE PHISHING: 
Creating fake websites that closely resemble legitimate ones in order to trick victims into entering sensitive information like login credentials or credit card numbers.
STEPS:
1. Attacker sends a victim a URL that appears to be from a trusted site.
2. The victim clicks on the link.
3. The victim thinks it's a legitimate site, so they enter their information.
4. The link is controlled by the attacker, so once they enter their information, it is captured by the attacker.

---

### BAITING:
Offering something enticing to the victim, such as free software, music, or a prize, to get them to perform a certain action, like downloading malware or giving up sensitive information.

---

### TAILGATING / PIGGYBACKING:
An attacker follows an authorized person into a secure area, typically a building or restricted space, by exploiting the victim's trust. The attacker might ask the victim to hold the door open or simply follow them in without proper credentials.

---

### IMPERSONATION:
Pretending to be someone else, such as a colleague, company executive, or authority figure, in order to gain access to sensitive information or systems.
HOW IT WORKS:
An attacker may call or email a victim, pretending to be from a trusted organization (e.g., pretending to be tech support) and tricking the victim into revealing personal information or providing access to a system.
### QUIZZES & SURVEYS:

---

### DUMPSTER DIVING:
Involves searching through trash or discarded documents to find useful information that can be exploited, often used as a form of information-gathering social engineering.
HOW IT WORKS:
- COLLECTING PHYSICAL DOCUMENTS: Attackers rummage through trash bins, dumpsters, or recycling containers to find sensitive information like passwords, financial records, company memos, or discarded devices that can be used for malicious purposes.
- EXPLOITING LEAKED INFORMATION:The stolen data can be used to perform identity theft, commit fraud, or access systems that rely on weak security protocols, like simple passwords or PINs.
---

### REVERSE SOCIAL ENGINEERING:
A form of social engineering where the attacker creates a scenario that prompts the victim to reach out to the attacker for help, rather than the attacker contacting the victim directly.
STEPS:
CREATING A PROBLEM OR CRISIS: The attacker may intentionally create a problem for the victim (such as introducing a technical issue, sending a malicious email, or locking them out of an account).
OFFERING A SOLUTION: Once the victim is aware of the problem, they are tricked into reaching out for help. The attacker then presents themselves as a trusted expert or authority (e.g., tech support, security personnel) and manipulates the victim into providing sensitive information, downloading malware, or giving unauthorized access.

---

### SHOULDER SURFING:
A physical type of social engineering where an attacker observes someone’s screen or actions to gather sensitive information.
HOW IT WORKS: 
- OBSERVING AND COLLECTING INFORMATION:  The attacker stands or sits near the victim (in public places or offices) and watches them type passwords, PINs, or access sensitive information displayed on their screens.
- NO TECHNICAL EXPLOITATION: Unlike digital hacking, shoulder surfing relies purely on the attacker’s ability to observe and memorize information, using physical proximity rather than exploiting technical vulnerabilities.

---

### CROWDSOURCING
Can be used for social engineering when attackers leverage the collective power of a large group of people to gather information or complete a task.
HOW IT WORKS IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING:
- EXPLOITING OF CROWD WISDOM: Attackers might create fake surveys, questionnaires, or petitions, gathering data from large groups of people unknowingly. For example, an attacker could design a survey that seems harmless but actually collects sensitive information (e.g., security questions, account details) that could be used for identity theft or hacking.
- MANIPULATING PUBLIC OPINION: Attackers may use social media platforms to crowdsource personal opinions, preferences, or vulnerabilities from users. This data could be used to target individuals with phishing, scams, or tailored social engineering attacks.

### WATERING HOLE ATTACK:
A targeted attack designed to compromise users within a specific industry or group of users by infecting websites they typically visit and luring them to a malicious site. The end goal is to infect the user’s computer with malware and gain access to the organization’s network. This really relies on luck, and become more effective when they are combined with email prompts to lure users to sites. 
STEPS:
1. The attacker researches the target and figures out which websites they are likely to visit, such as industry forums, blogs, or news sites.
2. The attacker then infects those websites with malicious content, usually through exploiting vulnerabilities in the website’s code.
3. When the victim visits the compromised website, the malware can be silently installed on their device or they might be redirected to phishing pages to steal their personal information.
---

### DIVERSION THEFT:
Attackers use diversionary tactics to distract security teams or individuals while they perform malicious actions like stealing sensitive data, installing malware, or compromising accounts. 
HOW IT WORKS:
- FAKE SECURITY ALERTS: The attacker sends fake alerts about a "breach" or "system failure" to draw attention away from their true goal. 
- SOCIAL ENGINEERING: The attacker could impersonate a trusted IT or security professional, calling or emailing the target with urgent instructions to "resolve an issue." The victim is then in a rush to fix the issue and may fall into a trap like downloading malicious files or giving out login credentials. 
- PHISHING CAMPAIGNS: The attacker may send phishing emails with fake security warnings that cause victis to click on malicious links, which then leads them to a phishing site, or downloads malware. 

---

### (BEC) BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE:
Attackers trick companies or individuals into transferring money or sensitive information by impersonating legitimate figures within the organization (CEO, CFO). It often involves manipulating employees into making wire transfers or sharing confidential information by exploiting trust. 
HOW IT WORKS:
- IMPERSONATION: The attaker compromises an email account or creates a fake one that looks like it belongs to a company executive or trusted figure. 
- FAKE REQUESTS: The attacker then sends an email to employees or partners asking for urgent actions, such as transferring funds, providing sensitive data, or even changing payment details for invoices.
- NO SUSPICION: Since the email appears to come from a trusted source (like the boss or vendor), the recipient doesn’t suspect anything suspicious and carries out the request, often leading to significant financial loss.

---

### HONEYTRAP:
An attacker lures the victim into a compromising situation, often using deception and seduction. It’s commonly used in espionage, blackmail, or gathering sensitive information.
STEPS:
1. FAKE PERSON: The attacker creates a fake online persona, often pretending to be someone the victim is attracted to, such as a romantic partner or colleague.
2. BUILDING TRUST: They build a relationship with the target, gaining their trust over time.
3. EXPLOITING THE RELATIONSHP: Once trust is established, the attacker might use the relationship to persuade the victim to share confidential information, perform actions (like installing malware), or even record compromising material (photos or videos) to extort them.

---
  
### SCAREWARE:
Attackers scare the victim into believing that their computer is infected with a virus or that there’s a severe security issue. The victim is then tricked into downloading malicious software or paying for fake “fixes.”
STEPS: 
1. FAKE WARNINGS: The attacker uses fake pop-up windows, often disguised as legitimate antivirus warnings, claiming that the victim’s computer is infected or has critical vulnerabilities.
2. URGENCY:The message usually insists that the issue needs to be fixed immediately, which causes the victim to panic and act quickly without thinking.
3. MALWARE OR PAYMENT:  Victims might be tricked into downloading malware that actually infects their system or paying for a fake software license or repair service that does nothing but steal money.
