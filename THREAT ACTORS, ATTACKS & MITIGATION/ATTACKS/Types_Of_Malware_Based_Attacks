### ADWARE
WHAT IT IS: Software that displays unwanted advertisements and may collect data without consent.
IMPACT: Annoys users, slows systems, and compromises privacy.
EXAMPLES: Fireball, CoolWebSearch.

### TROJANS
WHAT IT IS: Malware disguised as legitimate software to trick users into installing it.
IMPACT: Provides backdoor access to attackers, steals data, or facilitates other attacks.
EXAMPLES: Zeus Trojan, Emotet.

### WORMS
WHAT IT IS: Standalone malware that replicates itself to spread across networks without needing a host file or user interaction.
IMPACT: Consumes bandwidth, overloads networks, and disrupts services.
EXAMPLES: SQL Slammer, WannaCry.

### ROOTKITS
WHAT IT IS: Malware that provides privileged access to a system while hiding its presence.
IMPACT: Allows attackers to control and manipulate systems without detection.
EXAMPLES: Stuxnet, Zacinlo.

### VIRUSES:
WHAT IT IS: Malicious software that attaches itself to a legitimate program or file and spreads when the infected file is executed.
IMPACT: Can delete files, corrupt data, or disrupt system operations.
EXAMPLES: File infectors, macro viruses, boot sector viruses.

### BOTNETS:
WHAT IT IS:Networks of compromised devices controlled by attackers to perform coordinated attacks.
IMPACT: Used for DDoS attacks, spamming, and credential stuffing.
EXAMPLES: Mirai botnet, Storm botnet.

### FILELESS MALWARE:
WHAT IT IS: Operates in memory without writing files to the disk, making it hard to detect.
IMPACT: Evades traditional antivirus tools while stealing data or executing payloads.
EXAMPLES: PowerShell-based attacks, living-off-the-land techniques.

### CRYPTOJACKING:
