# Ad-Hoc Based Security

**Ad-Hoc Based Security** refers to an informal, reactive approach to managing and addressing security issues, where security measures are implemented on an as-needed basis without a structured, pre-planned strategy. This approach typically arises in response to immediate threats, vulnerabilities, or security incidents, rather than through ongoing, proactive management.

### Key Characteristics of Ad-Hoc Based Security:

1. **Reactive Approach**  
   Security measures are often deployed after an incident or threat is detected, rather than being planned and put in place ahead of time. For example, a company might introduce a new security protocol only after experiencing a breach.

2. **Lack of Structure**  
   Unlike structured, systematic security frameworks or strategies (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001, NIST), ad-hoc security tends to be disorganized and based on quick fixes, with no clear overarching policy or procedures.

3. **Unpredictability**  
   Since security decisions are made in response to specific events, the security posture may vary widely depending on the nature of the issue, the available resources, and the people involved.

4. **Short-Term Solutions**  
   Ad-hoc security solutions are often short-term or temporary fixes aimed at addressing immediate concerns. These solutions may not address underlying vulnerabilities in the long run.

5. **Limited Monitoring**  
   Continuous monitoring and ongoing security assessments are often lacking. Security efforts are focused on immediate, urgent concerns rather than on long-term, strategic security goals.

### Examples of Ad-Hoc Based Security:
- **Deploying a firewall** only after a network breach occurs, without having proactive plans for ongoing threat monitoring or intrusion detection.
- **Implementing password policies** after an employeeâ€™s account is compromised, instead of enforcing strong password requirements from the start.
- **Fixing vulnerabilities manually** after a breach occurs, rather than having automated systems in place to detect and patch vulnerabilities proactively.

### Limitations:
- **Ineffectiveness**: Ad-hoc security can leave gaps in security coverage because it lacks a comprehensive, strategic approach.
- **Increased Risk**: Because security measures are reactive, organizations may fail to address systemic issues or vulnerabilities until they cause significant damage.
- **Lack of Consistency**: The effectiveness of security measures can be inconsistent, depending on the urgency and context of the situation.
