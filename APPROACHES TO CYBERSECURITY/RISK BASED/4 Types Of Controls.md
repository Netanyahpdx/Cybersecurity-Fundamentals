# Types of Controls: Preventive, Detective, Corrective

In cybersecurity and risk management, **controls** are implemented to safeguard systems, data, and assets from potential threats. These controls are categorized into three main types: **Preventive**, **Detective**, and **Corrective**. Each type plays a unique role in ensuring the security and integrity of an organizationâ€™s infrastructure.

### 1. **Preventive Controls**

Preventive controls are designed to prevent security incidents or breaches from occurring in the first place. They proactively reduce the likelihood of risks by addressing vulnerabilities and blocking threats before they can materialize.

#### Examples of Preventive Controls:
- **Firewalls**: Restrict unauthorized access to networks, preventing potential intrusions.
- **Access Control Systems**: Use authentication mechanisms like passwords, biometrics, or multi-factor authentication (MFA) to limit access to sensitive data and systems.
- **Encryption**: Protect data in transit and at rest, ensuring that it cannot be accessed by unauthorized individuals.
- **Security Awareness Training**: Educate employees on safe practices, such as recognizing phishing attempts or avoiding risky websites.
- **Patch Management**: Regularly update software to fix known vulnerabilities and close security gaps.

#### Key Features:
- **Goal**: Prevent security incidents from occurring.
- **Focus**: Reducing the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
- **Application**: Before the risk occurs, acting as a first line of defense.

### 2. **Detective Controls**

Detective controls are designed to detect and identify security incidents, breaches, or any unauthorized activities in real-time or after they have occurred. These controls provide visibility into potential security threats, allowing organizations to react promptly.

#### Examples of Detective Controls:
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Monitor network traffic for suspicious or anomalous activity.
- **Log Monitoring and Analysis**: Collect and review system logs to identify signs of potential breaches or policy violations.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Aggregate and analyze data from various sources to detect unusual activities or patterns that indicate a security incident.
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain a detailed record of system and user activities, which can be analyzed for signs of unauthorized access or data manipulation.

#### Key Features:
- **Goal**: Identify and detect security incidents or unauthorized actions.
- **Focus**: Monitoring and alerting organizations to possible breaches.
- **Application**: After the threat or breach occurs, providing detection capabilities to minimize the damage.

### 3. **Corrective Controls**

Corrective controls are designed to mitigate the impact of a security incident or breach after it has been detected. These controls focus on restoring systems to normal functioning and preventing the recurrence of the issue.

#### Examples of Corrective Controls:
- **Incident Response Plans**: A structured approach for containing, managing, and recovering from security incidents, including predefined steps and roles for handling breaches.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Systems in place to restore lost data or services after an incident, ensuring business continuity.
- **System Patching and Updates**: Once vulnerabilities have been identified, corrective actions like applying security patches are taken to fix issues and prevent future exploitation.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigating the underlying cause of an incident to identify and fix the problem, preventing similar events in the future.

#### Key Features:
- **Goal**: Address and mitigate the impact of an incident after it occurs.
- **Focus**: Corrective measures and recovery processes.
- **Application**: After a security breach or incident, restoring systems and preventing future occurrences.
