**Purpose of Incident Response**
   - The purpose of incident response is to minimize the impact of a security incident, whether it's a data breach, ransomware attack, or a network intrusion. A structured IR process allows for:
     - Quick identification of the attack.
     - Effective containment and mitigation of the threat.
     - Efficient recovery of systems and data.
     - Root cause analysis to prevent future incidents.
