## Practical Example of Applying Risk Strategies
### Scenario: A company faces the risk of a ransomware attack.
- **Avoidance**: Discontinue using systems that store sensitive data.
- **Mitigation**: Implement endpoint protection and regular data backups.
- **Transfer**: Purchase cyber insurance to cover potential losses.
- **Acceptance**: Accept minor operational disruptions if backups are available.
- **Sharing**: Partner with a managed security service provider (MSSP) to monitor threats.
