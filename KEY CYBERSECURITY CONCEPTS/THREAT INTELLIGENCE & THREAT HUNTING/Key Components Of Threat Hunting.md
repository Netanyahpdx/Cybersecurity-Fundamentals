# Key Components of Threat Hunting

Threat hunting is the proactive approach to identifying and mitigating cyber threats that may bypass traditional security measures. It involves actively searching through networks, systems, and data to uncover hidden threats before they cause harm.

---

## 1. **Hypothesis-Driven Approach**
   - Threat hunting typically starts with a hypothesis or educated guess about potential threats or attack techniques that might be present within the organization. 
   - Examples: 
     - "An attacker may be exploiting a vulnerability in our web server."
     - "Unusual network traffic patterns may indicate a command-and-control (C2) channel."

## 2. **Data Collection and Analysis**
   - **Data Sources**: Security events, logs, network traffic, system behaviors, endpoint activity, threat intelligence feeds, etc.
   - **Log Aggregation**: Gathering data from various sources like Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), firewalls, endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, and more.
   - **Analysis**: The collected data is analyzed to identify suspicious patterns or anomalies that indicate potential security breaches or ongoing attacks.

## 3. **Threat Intelligence Integration**
   - Integrating external and internal threat intelligence helps hunters identify known attack patterns, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
   - Threat intelligence feeds provide information on emerging threats, threat actors, and attack methods that may be applicable to your environment.
   - Example: A hunter might use a threat intelligence feed to look for indicators of compromise (IOCs), such as IP addresses, domain names, or malware hashes, in network traffic.

## 4. **Detection of Anomalies**
   - **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying behaviors that deviate from the norm. These could include unexpected user activities, abnormal network traffic, or unfamiliar processes running on endpoints.
   - Examples:
     - An unusually high number of login attempts from an uncommon geographic location.
     - A server communicating with a known malicious IP address.

## 5. **Investigation**
   - Once suspicious activity is detected, further investigation is needed to determine whether itâ€™s a legitimate threat.
   - **Root Cause Analysis**: Understanding how and why the threat entered the system, including identifying exploited vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and any system compromises.
   - **Timeline Creation**: Establishing a timeline of events to map the progression of the attack or suspicious behavior.

## 6. **Hunting Tools and Techniques**
   - **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**: Tools that help monitor and analyze endpoint activities in real-time, identifying malicious activities or compromised devices.
   - **SIEM Systems**: Aggregates and analyzes logs from different data sources to help identify security incidents.
   - **Network Traffic Analysis**: Tools like Zeek, Suricata, or Wireshark that allow deep packet inspection and the analysis of network traffic for malicious patterns.
   - **Behavioral Analytics**: Identifies deviations from typical user or system behavior, often powered by machine learning or advanced algorithms.

---

## 7. **Collaboration and Communication**
   - Collaboration among different teams, such as security operations (SecOps), incident response, and IT departments, is crucial for effective threat hunting.
   - Threat hunters need to communicate findings quickly and clearly, including providing actionable insights that can lead to prompt mitigation and response actions.

---

## 8. **Response and Remediation**
   - If a threat is confirmed, hunters need to initiate containment strategies and remediation efforts, such as isolating infected systems, blocking malicious IP addresses, or applying patches.
   - After the attack is contained, threat hunters should participate in post-incident analysis to improve future hunting efforts.

---

## 9. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Threat hunting is an ongoing process, and the techniques and tools evolve with new threats.
   - After an investigation or response, hunting teams should update detection mechanisms, refine hypotheses, and improve overall security posture based on lessons learned from the threat hunting cycle.
   - Feedback loops and knowledge sharing between teams help develop more robust detection rules, threat models, and security defenses.

---

## 10. **Automation and Orchestration**
   - **Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks such as data collection, event correlation, and preliminary analysis can free up hunters to focus on more complex tasks.
   - **Orchestration**: Integrating various security tools and platforms (SIEM, EDR, IDS/IPS) to streamline workflows and responses, ensuring a faster and more coordinated reaction to threats.
