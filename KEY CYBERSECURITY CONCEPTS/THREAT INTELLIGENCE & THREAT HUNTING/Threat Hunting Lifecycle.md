# Threat Hunting Lifecycle

The **Threat Hunting Lifecycle** is a structured approach to proactively searching for signs of malicious activity within an organization's network, endpoints, or systems. It consists of multiple phases, from the initial hypothesis creation to final reporting, with continuous feedback loops to refine and improve the process.

---

## 1. **Hypothesis Creation**
   - **Objective**: Develop a hypothesis or assumption based on the latest threat intelligence or patterns from previous attacks.
   - This is the starting point of the threat hunting lifecycle, where security analysts generate a theory about potential threats, such as specific attack techniques or indicators of compromise (IOCs).
   - **Examples**:
     - Hunting for evidence of lateral movement after a successful initial compromise.
     - Searching for anomalous network traffic patterns associated with a known malware campaign.

## 2. **Data Collection**
   - **Objective**: Gather relevant data from various sources for analysis.
   - This phase involves collecting logs, network traffic, endpoint data, and other telemetry that may contain evidence of malicious activity.
   - **Data Sources**:
     - Network traffic logs (e.g., firewall, proxy logs).
     - Endpoint logs (e.g., EDR or antivirus data).
     - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system data.
     - Threat intelligence feeds (e.g., known IOCs, TTPs).

## 3. **Data Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Analyze the collected data for indicators of compromise or suspicious patterns.
   - In this phase, security analysts manually or with automated tools analyze the data to identify any anomalies, patterns, or known attack techniques.
   - **Techniques Used**:
     - **Correlation**: Linking related events and identifying relationships between different data sources.
     - **Anomaly detection**: Identifying activities that deviate from normal behavior.
     - **Pattern recognition**: Looking for known attack signatures or behavior.

---

## 4. **Investigation**
   - **Objective**: Investigate any suspicious findings or anomalies in detail.
   - When potential threats are detected, analysts conduct deeper investigations to confirm whether these activities represent a real security incident or a false positive.
   - **Steps in Investigation**:
     - **Contextualization**: Understanding the context of suspicious activity (e.g., user activity, network traffic).
     - **Root Cause Analysis**: Identifying the origin of the attack and the methods used.
     - **Containment**: If an active threat is confirmed, steps are taken to isolate the affected systems.

---

## 5. **Response and Remediation**
   - **Objective**: Respond to identified threats and mitigate their impact.
   - Once a threat is confirmed, the security team implements response measures to contain, eradicate, and recover from the attack.
   - **Actions in Response**:
     - **Containment**: Quarantine affected systems or isolate network segments to stop the attack from spreading.
     - **Eradication**: Remove malicious files, processes, or backdoors from compromised systems.
     - **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation and patch any vulnerabilities exploited by the attacker.

---

## 6. **Reporting and Documentation**
   - **Objective**: Document findings and response actions for future analysis and compliance.
   - Throughout the threat hunting lifecycle, it's crucial to document the process, findings, and actions taken. This reporting can be used for future threat intelligence, incident response, and compliance purposes.
   - **Key Reporting Points**:
     - **Detailed findings**: What was found during the hunt and what tools or techniques were used to uncover it.
     - **Response actions**: Steps taken to contain and mitigate the threat.
     - **Lessons learned**: What worked well and what improvements can be made for future hunts.

---

## 7. **Feedback and Continuous Improvement**
   - **Objective**: Use the results of the hunt to refine future hunting efforts and improve security posture.
   - After the hunt, feedback is gathered to improve detection capabilities, enhance tools, and refine processes. This ensures that future hunts are more effective and efficient.
   - **Feedback Loop**:
     - Review what threat hunting techniques worked best and adjust the hypothesis creation phase.
     - Update threat intelligence with new IOCs or TTPs discovered during the hunt.
     - Use insights from investigations to tune security controls and detection mechanisms.
