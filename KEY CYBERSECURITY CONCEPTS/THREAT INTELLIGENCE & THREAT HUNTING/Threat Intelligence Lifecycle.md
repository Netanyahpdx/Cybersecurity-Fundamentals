## Threat Intelligence Lifecycle

1. **Collection**:
   - Gathering raw data from internal and external sources such as network logs, threat feeds, and social media.

2. **Processing**:
   - Filtering and cleaning the data to make it useful. This involves identifying relevant threats and transforming raw data into structured information.

3. **Analysis**:
   - Analyzing the processed data to uncover patterns, trends, and emerging threats. This often involves correlating various data sources and comparing them with existing knowledge.

4. **Dissemination**:
   - Sharing the analyzed intelligence with appropriate stakeholders within the organization. This can include creating reports, alerts, or automated systems that help detect threats.

5. **Action**:
   - Using the intelligence to improve defenses, respond to incidents, and take preventive measures. This could include updating firewall rules, deploying patches, or initiating investigations.
