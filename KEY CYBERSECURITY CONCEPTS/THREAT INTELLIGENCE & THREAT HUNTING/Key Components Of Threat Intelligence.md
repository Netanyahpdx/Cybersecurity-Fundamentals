## Key Components of Threat Intelligence

1. **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**:
   - Pieces of evidence that suggest a security breach has occurred. Common IOCs include file hashes, IP addresses, domain names, and URLs used by attackers.

2. **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)**:
   - Descriptions of the behavior or modus operandi of attackers, including their attack methods and tools. The MITRE ATT&CK framework is commonly used to document TTPs.

3. **Threat Actors**:
   - The individuals, groups, or organizations responsible for cyber-attacks. Understanding the motives, objectives, and capabilities of these actors helps anticipate future threats.

4. **Threat Campaigns**:
   - Coordinated efforts by threat actors to achieve specific objectives, often over an extended period. Identifying and tracking these campaigns helps predict their next steps.
